AEGIS SOURCE CODE

Well, here it is. Since I can't get Shogo to work on Windows 10 anymore, I might as well just release what I have, an unfinished build, the source code and everything else going into a REZ file (also included). Check the changelog and goals files for stuff that's changed in the code and stuff I would have changed if I was able to do more. You can find the comments for Aegis changes by searching for "//AEGIS". I used Visual C++ 6.0 for all the work since that is what Monolith supported, don't know about other IDEs\compilers.

This also includes code for Wobak's widescreen patch that they lended to me and gave me permission to include. I wasn't able to implement it, you can find what code is changed by searching for "//NEW//" in the code provided.

(And if you don't mind, if you make your own fork of Aegis, please, for the love of God, remove the current "MUSIC1.WAV" file from the REZ, that change was stupid, or as the kids like to say, "soulless". Thanks.)
